***Hello! I am CuriosityByte, a.k.a. "Cur10s1tyByt3", a Computer Science student (with a strong passion for CyberSecurity) driven by an unquenchable curiosity to explore the dynamic digital landscape. My journey into ethical hacking and cybersecurity ignited when I was just 12 years old, and it has since transformed into a dedicated pursuit. I aim to understand the intricate workings of technology and its security, mastering the techniques needed to counteract threats and safeguard systems from potential damage.***

***Started with mobile game hacking (APK patching/modding), and explored Java programming for a time. I then delved into malware analysis and some aspects of .NET Reverse Engineering (using tools like dnSpy, .NET Reflector, ILSpy, Resource Hacker, Process Hacker {now known as System Informer}, x96dbg, HxD ...). Currently, I am advancing my skills in C/C++ programming.***

***Regarding my strengths, I am highly motivated and have a keen eye for every detail. I am also a quick learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and experience in the cybersecurity realm.***
